    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This lasagna is based on my spinach artichoke lasagna on the blog and the
      roasted eggplant lasagna in my cookbook. I love those less-conventional
      vegetarian lasagnas.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Veggies and spinach</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>cottage cheese</li>
      <li>lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>
        To prepare the veggies: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the
        olive oil. Once shimmering, add the carrots, bell pepper, zucchini,
        yellow onion, and salt. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until
        the veggies are golden on the edges, about 8 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until
        the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all
        of the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the
        heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, to prepare the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a mesh
        sieve or fine colander and drain off the excess juice for a minute.
        Then, transfer the drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add
        the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to
        an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later
        (you should have a little over 2 cups sauce). Rinse out the food
        processor and return it to the machine.
      </li>
    </ol>
